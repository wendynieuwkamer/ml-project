\section{Hyper parameter optimization}

The goal of hyper parameter optimization is to find the best hyperparameters for the given classifier, in order to optimise the loss function and to avoid overfitting \cite{}. Some hyper parameter optimisation 
We needed an algorithm to find the best way to tune the hyper parameters of our chosen classifiers.  As we were recommended grid search, this was the first algorithm we decided to look into.  

\subsection{Grid Search}
It does this by iterating over all of the variables in a given range, and selecting the best combination to use in the chosen classifier. 
Grid search methodically works through a given range of inputs for each of the hyper parameters. Each input is tested to find the combination of hyper parameters that yield the best results from the given classifier. 
As grid search was recommended to us, and is the most widely used way to optimize hyper parameters, we decided to use it in our project.
